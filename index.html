  <b>The Basics of the Web and HTML</b><br>
<br>

<br>
<b>The World Wide Web <br></b>
It's a collection of HTML documents.
The links between the pages are called Hyper Links.
<br>

<br>
<b>File Types <br></b>
On the web we can find plain text, HTML, images, videos and music.
<br>

<br>
<b>Components of the Web <br></b>
Browser: A program that runs on your computer to display files found on the web <br> 
The internet: The world's largest computer network <br>
HTTP: The main protocol of the web <br>
Servers: Computers that host the files that make up the web <br>
<br>

<b>HTML Basics <br></b>
<em>HyperText Markup Language</em> is made by text content, markup, references to other documents and
links to other pages. <br>
<br>

<b>HTML Tags <br></b>
Tags are structured with an opening and closing tag, which have in the middle the content. The whole thing is refered to as the 
element.<br>
<br>
<b>Why computers are studpid<br></b>
It is very important that we are carefull and we code correctly. Otherwise, the computer will not understand your order and 
mistakes will start to appear, as it will follow your orders literally.<br>
<br>
<b>Inline vs Block elements<br></b>
HTML elements can be inline or block. Elements like anchor (a) are inlines whilst others like paragraph (p) are blocks.
Block makes an invisible box around the element, that has a height and width whilst inline elements
are just text.<br>
<br>

<b>The 5 important things to remember: <br></b>
1) What a web page is <br>
2) How coding works <br>
3) Computers are stupid
<br>
4) Programmers can't remeber everything <br>
5) Basic HTML vocabulary (tag, element, attribute)
